Coronary Heart Disease (CHD) Risk Prediction

Project Overview

This project aims to predict the risk of developing Ten-Year Coronary Heart Disease (CHD) based on a dataset containing various patient features. The model used for prediction is Logistic Regression.

Dataset

The dataset includes patient-specific features such as:

Age

Sex

glucose

Smoking Status

Diabetes

BMI

These features are utilized to train and evaluate the predictive model.

Methodology

Data Preprocessing:

Handling missing values

Feature scaling and normalization

Splitting data into training and testing sets

Model Training:

Logistic Regression is trained using the processed dataset

Model Evaluation:

Various performance metrics are used to assess the effectiveness of the model:

Accuracy

Precision

Recall

F1-Score

Confusion Matrix

Results and Analysis

The trained Logistic Regression model provides an evaluation based on key classification metrics.

The confusion matrix helps visualize the performance of the model.

The model's effectiveness can be further improved using hyperparameter tuning and additional features.
