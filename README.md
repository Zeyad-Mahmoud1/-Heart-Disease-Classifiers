# 🏥 Coronary Heart Disease (CHD) Risk Prediction

## 📌 Project Overview
This project aims to predict the risk of developing **Ten-Year Coronary Heart Disease (CHD)** based on a dataset containing various patient features. The model used for prediction is **Logistic Regression**.

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset includes patient-specific features such as:
- 🏷 **Age**
- 🧑 **Sex**
- 🧫 **Glucose**
- 🚬 **Smoking Status**
- 💉 **Diabetes**
- ⚖ **BMI**

These features are utilized to train and evaluate the predictive model.

## 🔍 Methodology
### 🔹 Data Preprocessing:
- Handling missing values
- Feature scaling and normalization
- Splitting data into training and testing sets

### 🔹 Model Training:
- **Logistic Regression** is trained using the processed dataset

### 🔹 Model Evaluation:
Various performance metrics are used to assess the effectiveness of the model:
- ✅ **Accuracy**
- ✅ **Precision**
- ✅ **Recall**
- ✅ **F1-Score**
- ✅ **Confusion Matrix**

## 📈 Results and Analysis
- The trained **Logistic Regression** model provides an evaluation based on key classification metrics.
- The **confusion matrix** helps visualize the performance of the model.
- The model's effectiveness can be further improved using **hyperparameter tuning** and additional features.
